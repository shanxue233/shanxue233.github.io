Among all the methods, ligand engineering is the most straightforward and facile one to design Au NCs with the desired PL properties. However, a systematic understanding of the ligand effects toward electron–phonon interactions in Au NCs is still missing. Herein, we synthesized four Au25(SR)18– NCs protected by different −SR ligands and carefully examined their temperature-dependent band-gap renormalization behavior. Data analysis by a Bose–Einstein two-oscillator model revealed a suppression of high-frequency optical phonons in aromatic-ligand-protected Au25 NCs. Meanwhile, a low-frequency breathing mode and a quadrupolar mode are attributed as the main contributors to the phonon-assisted nonradiative relaxation pathway in aromatic-ligand-protected Au25 NCs, which is in contrast with non-aromatic-ligand-protected Au25 NCs, in which tangential and radial modes play the key roles. The PL measurements of the four Au25 NCs showed that the suppression of optical phonons led to higher quantum yields in aromatic-ligand-protected Au25 NCs. Cryogenic PL measurements provide insights into the nonradiative energy relaxation, which should be further investigated for a full understanding of the PL mechanism in Au25 NCs.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Tailoring the Electron–Phonon Interaction in Au25(SR)18 Nanoclusters via Ligand Engineering and Insight into Luminescence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivia M Manley","Han N Phan","Allison K Stewart","Dontae A Mosley","Shan Xue","Lide Cha","Hongxia Bai","Veda C Lightfoot","Pierson A Rucker","Leonard Collins","Taufika Islam Williams","Wei-Chen Chang","Yisong Guo","Thomas M Makris"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary Information is here, including data.\n","date":1661299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661299200,"objectID":"e49cf031d5d593d3b5f81c87cb46acfe","permalink":"https://shanxue233.github.io/publication/cadd/","publishdate":"2022-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cadd/","section":"publication","summary":"Chlamydia protein associating with death domains (CADD) is involved in the biosynthesis of para-aminobenzoate (pABA), an essential component of the folate cofactor that is required for the survival and proliferation of the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. The pathway used by Chlamydiae for pABA synthesis differs from the canonical multi-enzyme pathway used by most bacteria that relies on chorismate as a metabolic precursor. Rather, recent work showed pABA formation by CADD derives from l-tyrosine. As a member of the emerging superfamily of heme oxygenase–like diiron oxidases (HDOs), CADD was proposed to use a diiron cofactor for catalysis. However, we report maximal pABA formation by CADD occurs upon the addition of both iron and manganese, which implicates a heterobimetallic Fe:Mn cluster is the catalytically active form. Isotopic labeling experiments and proteomics studies show that CADD generates pABA from a protein-derived tyrosine (Tyr27), a residue that is ∼14 Å from the dimetal site. We propose that this self-sacrificial reaction occurs through O2 activation by a probable Fe:Mn cluster through a radical relay mechanism that connects to the “substrate” Tyr, followed by amination and direct oxygen insertion. These results provide the molecular basis for pABA formation in C. trachomatis, which will inform the design of novel therapeutics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Self-sacrificial tyrosine cleavage by an Fe:Mn oxygenase for the biosynthesis of para-aminobenzoate in Chlamydia trachomatis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojun Li","Shan Xue","Yisong Guo","Wei-Chen Chang"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary Information is here, including data.\n","date":1651104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651104000,"objectID":"e143d4f2eeaf0c33a9883c7404af32f8","permalink":"https://shanxue233.github.io/publication/dfmd/","publishdate":"2022-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dfmd/","section":"publication","summary":"Utilization of mononuclear iron- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) enzymes to enable C–H bond functionalization is a widely used strategy to diversify the structural complexity of natural products. Besides those well-studied reactions including hydroxylation, epoxidation, and halogenation, in the biosynthetic pathway of dehydrofosmidomycin, an Fe/2OG enzyme is reported to catalyze desaturation, alkyl chain elongation, along with demethylation in which trimethyl-2-aminoethylphosphonate is converted into methyldehydrofosmidomycin. How this transformation takes place is largely unknown. Herein, we characterized the reactive species, revealed the structure of the reaction intermediate, and used mechanistic probes to investigate the reaction pathway and mechanism. These results led to the elucidation of a two-step process in which the first reaction employs a long-lived Fe(IV)-oxo species to trigger C═C bond installation. During the second reaction, the olefin installed in situ enables C–C bond formation that is accompanied with a C–N bond cleavage and hydroxylation to furnish the alkyl chain elongation and demethylation. This work expands the reaction repertoire of Fe/2OG enzymes by introducing a new pathway to the known C–C bond formation mechanisms utilized by metalloenzymes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Mechanism of Methyldehydrofosmidomycin Maturation: Use Olefination to Enable Chain Elongation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivia M Manley","Haoyu Tang","Shan Xue","Yisong Guo","Wei-chen Chang","Thomas M Makris"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary Information is here, including data.\n","date":1639353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639353600,"objectID":"37b72a74d99fbcc23b6d203dca622c53","permalink":"https://shanxue233.github.io/publication/besc/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/besc/","section":"publication","summary":"BesC catalyzes the iron- and O2-dependent cleavage of 4-chloro-l-lysine to form 4-chloro-l-allylglycine, formaldehyde, and ammonia. This process is a critical step for a biosynthetic pathway that generates a terminal alkyne amino acid which can be leveraged as a useful bio-orthogonal handle for protein labeling. As a member of an emerging family of diiron enzymes that are typified by their heme oxygenase-like fold and a very similar set of coordinating ligands, recently termed HDOs, BesC performs an unusual type of carbon–carbon cleavage reaction that is a significant departure from reactions catalyzed by canonical dinuclear-iron enzymes. Here, we show that BesC activates O2 in a substrate-gated manner to generate a diferric-peroxo intermediate. Examination of the reactivity of the peroxo intermediate with a series of lysine derivatives demonstrates that BesC initiates this unique reaction trajectory via cleavage of the C4–H bond; this process represents the rate-limiting step in a single turnover reaction. The observed reactivity of BesC represents the first example of a dinuclear-iron enzyme that utilizes a diferric-peroxo intermediate to capably cleave a C–H bond as part of its native function, thus circumventing the formation of a high-valent intermediate more commonly associated with substrate monooxygenations.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"BesC Initiates C–C Cleavage through a Substrate-Triggered and Reactive Diferric-Peroxo Intermediate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tzu-Yu Chen","Shan Xue","Wei-Chih Tsai","Tun-Cheng Chien","Yisong Guo","Wei-Chen Chang"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary Information is here, including data.\n","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"c6e3e1ebfc3732f0f221cf0b1d2fb75a","permalink":"https://shanxue233.github.io/publication/kabc/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kabc/","section":"publication","summary":"metalloenzyme, C−H activation, cyclization, desaturation, enzyme mechanism","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Deciphering pyrrolidine and olefin formation mechanism in kainic acid biosynthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lide Cha","Sergey Milikisiyants","Madison Davidson","Shan Xue","Tatyana Smirnova","Alex Smirnov","Yisong Guo","Wei-chen Chang"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary Information is here, including data.\n","date":1589328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589328000,"objectID":"4b8cf6c88057b8624d8821bf0e4725f4","permalink":"https://shanxue233.github.io/publication/ldoa/","publishdate":"2021-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ldoa/","section":"publication","summary":"Applying enzymatic reactions to produce useful molecules is a central focus of chemical biology.
